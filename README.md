# slip.js
A performant Scheme interpreter, written in [asm.js](http://asmjs.org).

## Introduction

Slip.js is an efficient Scheme (more precisely, [Slip](https://github.com/noahvanes/slip.js/raw/master/varia/Slip.pdf)),
interpreter, written manually in asm.js for better performance. It makes use of the [sweet.js](http://sweetjs.org) macro
expander to facilitate the writing of asm.js code by hand.

[More information to follow soon...]

## Running slip.js

To run slip.js, simply open ```index.html``` for an interactive slip.js REPL in your browser of choice (preferably Firefox).

Alternatively, one can also open a slip.js REPL in a shell using either:
  - ```js spiderslip.js``` (for SpiderMonkey)
  - ```d8 d8slip.js``` (for V8/d8 shell)
  - ```jsc jscslip.js``` (for JavaScriptCore)

## Notes

* The interpreter is still work in progress, it does not fully implement the SLIP specification yet...

* The file ```slip.js``` contains the asm.js that was generated by the sweet.js macro expander. The original source code
can be found in ```slip.sjs```. If you want to make changes to this file, you can rebuild ```slip.js``` by running ```./build.sh```,
assuming you have sweet.js installed on your system.
